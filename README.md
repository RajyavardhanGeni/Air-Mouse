# Air-Mouse
Designed an alternative gesture-based mouse system using Arduino and MPU6050 for boards incompatible with the Mouse.h library.
– Processed and corrected data from the MPU6050 sensor and transmitted it via serial communication to a computer.
– Developed a Python script to interpret sensor data and control mouse movement based on tilt angles.
– Implemented a user-controlled Mouse Enable button and a reset feature for gyro recalibration.
– Optimized the MPU6050_tockn.h library to enhance performance and adaptability for various setups.
– Tools & technologies used: Arduino Uno/Nano, MPU6050, Python, Arduino IDE, Serial Communication.
